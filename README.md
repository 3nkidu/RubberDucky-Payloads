All payloads are for educational purposes only. ;)

## How to use

All payloads come in .txt you'll need to encode them yourself.

### Encode

You can use DuckToolkit.com or download the duckencode.jar from hack5

If you are using duckencode use the command:$ java -jar duckencoder.jar -i [file-name.txt]
you can use -o to specify and output name for the file otherwise it outputs inject.bin
